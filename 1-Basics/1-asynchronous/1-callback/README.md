# Callback

* A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.

* In the real world, callbacks are most often used with asynchronous functions.

## Callback Alternatives
With asynchronous programming, JavaScript programs can start long-running tasks, and continue running other tasks in paralell.

But, asynchronus programmes are difficult to write and difficult to debug.

Because of this, most modern asynchronous JavaScript methods don't use callbacks. Instead, in JavaScript, asynchronous programming is solved using Promise or Async/Await instead.
